# TAS about

## Explanation

This is a slideshow document I've made about Speedrun and Tool-Assisted Speedrun.

I have deliberately skipped some parts like bounties, memes and cheats just to keep the essential ones (IMO).

If you have any question or comment, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request to suggest some content.
